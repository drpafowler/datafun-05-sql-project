# datafun-05-sql-project

## Overview
Project 5 integrates Python and SQL, focusing on database interactions using SQLite. This project introduces logging, a useful tool for debugging and monitoring projects, and involves creating and managing a database, building a schema, and performing various SQL operations, including queries with joins, filters, and aggregations.

## Files

The database files come from the MySQL World database that I already had in PostgreSQL for another class.  I exported the database to three separate csv files.  

Several scripts were written.
create_tables.sql was modified from the file by the same name that was used earlier in module 5.

world_manager.py was modified from book_manager.py from earlier in module 5

These two files were used to create the project.db database.

The Jupyter notebook file simple_db_query.ipynb was used to connect to the project.db database and run queries
